## Welcome

👋 Hi. I am Hung. I am currently a full-time open source contributor 🧑‍💻. Previously, I was working at [Got It](https://www.got-it.co/) as a Lead Frontend Developer.

⚡️ I am obsessed with Developer Experience (DX), so I created [jest-preview](https://github.com/nvh95/jest-preview) 🖼 to help frontend engineers to write and debug Jest tests effortlessly. If you are a frontend engineer, [check it out](https://github.com/nvh95/jest-preview). I promise you will love it 😍!
